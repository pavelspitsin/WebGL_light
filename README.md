# WebGL_light

This demo is the result of my study of WebGl and computer graphics in general.  
At the moment the following is done:
* Phong lighting
* Loading 3d models and materials (*.obj, *.mtl)
* Normal mapping
  
  
The nanosuit model is taken from: https://github.com/JoeyDeVries/LearnOpenGL  
The barrel model is taken from (link in description): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DUfwAEx4Ts&t=271s


You can see the result [here](https://pavelspitsin.github.io/demos/WebGLRender.html).
